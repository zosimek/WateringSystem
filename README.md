# WateringSystem
A project for an automated irrigation system using a raspberry pi 4b to read soil moisture levels and control water pumps. The hardware is controlled by an Android application written in Kotlin. The app allows setting one of three irrigation modes: smart, automatic, and manual.

The "final" basic version of the application - subject to assessment from the ZPAM course - is available in tag v.1.0.
